# Catalog Format

Provider definitions in `src/providers/<service>/definition.ts` are the source of truth.
`npm run generate:catalog` writes `catalog/apps/<service>.json` and the startup index
`catalog/apps-index.json` together; both are generated local runtime data used by the server at
startup, and neither must be hand-edited. Generated registry and catalog files are ignored by git.
`npm install`, `npm run dev`, and `npm start` create them when they are missing or stale.

Provider executors live in `src/providers/<service>/executors.ts` and are loaded only when an action is executed.

Do not hand-edit generated catalog files as source. Update provider definitions and run:

```bash
npm run generate:catalog
```

At runtime, catalog responses add execution status that is not stored in generated catalog JSON:

- `locallyExecutable`: the open-source runtime has a local executor for the action.
- `catalogOnly`: schemas and metadata are available, but no local executor is wired yet.
- `needsCredential`: the provider needs a configured local connection before execution.
- `noAuthRunnable`: the action belongs to a provider that can run without stored credentials.

Action definitions also declare provider-native `requiredScopes` and `providerPermissions`. The
runtime exposes those fields through HTTP and MCP discovery together with the current connection
profile, so agents can see both the capability they are about to use and the account it will run as.
